# HI, I AM JOHN HETLAGE

I am a developer based in Kanasas City...

> Talk is Cheap. Show me the Code <br />  - Linus Torvalds

### Coder

I view programming languages as though they are different forms of martial arts. Like martial arts, there is always someone who knows more than you and someone who knows less. My kung fu is Python. My karate is JavaScript. Arts practiced everyday.

### Maker

I'm escpecially proud of nerdy collection of SBCs (single board computers). I have built a portable modular compute platform, an Alexa/Google Home hybrid, and many other gadgets. Other Maker projects can be found here. //TODO add link to projects

### Hacker

As an honorary member of the house of Slytherin, I can cast dark magic spells to cast wireless attacks, reverse engineer programs, and gather information. For my practices of the dark arts, I use Kali Linux and Parrot OS.    

### Cloud Architect
Direct trade is a form of sourcing practiced by some coffee roasters. Advocates of direct trade practices promote direct communication and price negotiation between buyer and farmer, along with systems that encourage and incentivize quality.
