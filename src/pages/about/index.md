# Welcome to John's Research and Internet of Things.

My name is John Hetlage and I currently reside in Kanasas City. I consider myself to be a lifelong student. I am very passionate about technology and the ethics behind it. I started out from a manufacturing background and worked as a machinist. One day I finally decided it wasn't for me and threw my career away. I am both self taught and formally educated in various subject  of technology. 

## I am a . . .

### Coder
I view programming languages as though they are different forms of martial arts. Like martial arts, there is always someone who knows more than you and someone who knows less. My kung fu is Python. My karate is JavaScript. Arts practiced everyday.

### Maker
I'm escpecially proud of nerdy collection of SBCs (single board computers). I have built a portable modular compute platform, an Alexa/Google Home hybrid, and many other gadgets. Other Maker projects can be found here. //TODO add link to projects

### Hacker
As an honorary member of the house of Slytherin, I can cast dark magic spells to cast wireless attacks, reverse engineer programs, and gather information. For my practices of the dark arts, I use Kali Linux and Parrot OS.    

### Cloud Architect
In the kitchen where Infrastructure, Containers, and Functions meet, I am a pizzaiolo. Ensuring that each slice of the pizza is cooked to perfection and on-time.
